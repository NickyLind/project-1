          <h2>Background info!</h2>
            <p>I graduated Lake Superior college in Minnesota with an Associate's in Welding Tehcnology. I started aluminum welding and fabricating aluminum government boats
              and ended up in Vancouver, WA welding structural steel (bridges, building, etc.). While it can be fast-paced a lot of the time, welding also has large slow-downs and lay-offs 
              multiple times a year, as we as being pretty demanding physically. I always had an interest in learning programming so I decided to switch course while i was still relatively young,
              and that's how i wound up at Epicous!
